The files I have pushed omits the data files referenced due to large size. The data files referenced are downloaded from PWC's case site, and placed within "data" file in "approach". 
Additionally, Thailand's shapefiles were also downloaded from HDX and placed in "data/geospatial".
The quarto site has been rendered on netlify accessible here: https://lomo-case-challenge-youyunpeng.netlify.app/problemstatement/problemstatement.
